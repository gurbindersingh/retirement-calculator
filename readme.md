# Retirement Calculator

It's easy to find information about how much you need to save or invest to have enough in retirement. But unless you run the numbers yourself, it's still difficult to imagine how much you'll actually have and how long it's going to last.

This is a simple web app to visualize exactly that. There are plenty of other similar apps out there. But those are often either US-focused or were missing some of the variables I needed. So I created my own.
