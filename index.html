                        This calculator is only meant to serve as a ballpark estimate and
                        is by no means 100% accurate because we have to make simplified
                        assumptions for certain things.

                <p>
                    The living costs are calculated using the value for contributions
                    towards saving:
                    <code>living costs = salary * (100% - contributions)</code>. From
                    there, for each year the salary is increased by the specified factor
                    and the living costs by inflation rate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The annual savings are calculated by subtracting living costs from the
                    salary and then adding the result to the total savings. We multiply
                    each year's total savings by the annual rate of return. Specifically,
                    the total savings available for any given year is equal to
                    <code
                        >(previous year's total savings) * rate of return + current year's
                        savings</code
                    >. This is similar to how a savings account typically works, and for
                    simplicity, we apply the same logic to investments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is a simplification in how the tax is applied, however. Most
                    people invest in ETFs or mutual funds and do not withdraw from these
                    investments until needed. Therefore, the calculator assumes that taxes
                    are paid only when you sell your investments (capital gains tax) and
                    ignores taxes on dividends. This is partly because the applicable tax
                    depends on the country; it might be income tax or capital gains tax.
                    To account for this inaccuracy, you can use a slightly lower value for
                    the rate of return.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note that this calculator does not consider expenses like a mortgage,
                    which would end after a certain period. To account for that, you
                    could, for example, subtract the annual mortgage payments from your
                    salary instead.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once living costs exceed income, we start using our savings. In this
                    case, we use the tax rate to calculate how much we need to withdraw or
                    sell to cover the deficit for that year. This is another
                    simplification because, in the case of investments, it might not
                    always be possible to sell the exact amount needed.

                    [1] If your salary does not increase every year, you can easily
                    calculate the yearly value by taking the n-th root of the total
                    increase, where n is the number of years. For example, if you started
                    your job in 2024 with an annual net salary of 50,000 and then in 2027
                    you switch jobs and have a salary of 55,000, this is an increase of
                    10% (a factor of <code>1.10</code>). To find the annual increase,
                    calculate <code>nth_root(3, 1.10) or 1.10^(1/3) = ~1.03228...</code>,
                    which is approximately 3.23%.
