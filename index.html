            A generic retirement calculator to help you figure out how much you'll have
            when you retire.

                <h3 class="">How it works</h3>
                <p>
                    The calculator uses the value for your contributions towards saving to
                    determine the living costs:
                    <code>living costs = salary * (100% - contributions)</code>. From
                    there for each year the salary is increased by the specified factor
                    and the living costs by inflation value.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The yearly savings are calculated by subtracting the living costs from
                    the salary, they are then added to the total savings. We multiply each
                    years total by the annual rate of return. To be more specific, the
                    total savings you have access to for any given year is:
                    <code
                        >(previous year's total savings) * rate of return + current years
                        savings</code
                    >. This is similar to how a savings account usually works and to
                    simplify we also apply the same logic to investments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the living costs outpace the income, we start using up our
                    savings. For that we use the value of the tax to calculate how much we
                    need to withdraw/sell (the gross value) in order to have an amount
                    that is equal the deficit for that year.
