            A generic retirement calculator to help you figure out how much you'll have

                        This calculator is only meant to serve as a ballpark estimate and
                        is by no means 100% accurate because we have to make simplified
                        assumptions for certain things.
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The living costs are calculated using the value for contributions
                    towards saving:
                    <code>living costs = salary * (100% - contributions)</code>. From
                    there, for each year the salary is increased by the specified factor
                    and the living costs by inflation rate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The annual savings are calculated by subtracting the living costs from
                    the salary, they are then added to the total savings. We multiply each
                    years total by the annual rate of return. To be more specific, the
                    total savings you have access to for any given year is equal to
                    <code
                        >(previous year's total savings) * rate of return + current years
                        savings</code
                    >. This is similar to how a savings account usually works and to
                    simplify we also apply the same logic to investments. Note that this
                    calculator also doesn't take into things like a mortgage, which would
                    stop after a certain period. To account for that you could for example
                    subtract the annual mortgage payments from your salary instead.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the living costs overtake the income, we start using up our
                    savings. For that we use the tax to calculate how much we need to
                    withdraw/sell in order to have an amount that is equal the deficit for
                    that year. This is another simplification because in case of
                    investments we might not always be able to sell exactly the amount we
                    need.
